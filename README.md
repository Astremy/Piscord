# Piscord

Piscord is a python framework to communicate with the Discord api.


In particular, it simplifies the creation of a bot that interacts with a Web server.
It thus allows to do much more easily various things like bot control panels.

Thus, in all the examples, Piscord is used with [SAPAS](https://github.com/Astremy/SAPAS).
